<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science student at The Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo, pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree with a GPA of 86.  <br />   
My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in Advanced Programming in C, Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Architecture,  <br /> 
and Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a NOC & Support tier 3 specialist at WaveBL, where I leverage advanced MySQL skills to optimize system performance  <br /> 
and maintain data integrity. I collaborate with R&D teams to resolve critical issues and have developed a deep understanding of blockchain  <br /> 
technology. My experience includes working with Kubernetes for log analysis and developing SQL-based automation solutions that have reduced  <br /> 
issue resolution time by 20%.</p>

<p>Previously, I served in the IDF's Unit 81 Intelligence Corpse as an Automation Developer for Hardware Testing. In this role, I specialized  <br /> 
in creating automated test setups for hardware testing and collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of hardware  <br /> 
and software components. My innovative testing methodologies contributed to significant improvements in performance and reliability.</p>
