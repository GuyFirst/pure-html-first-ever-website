My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in Advanced Programming in C, Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Architecture, 
and Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a NOC & Support tier 3 specialist at WaveBL, where I leverage advanced MySQL skills to optimize system performance 
and maintain data integrity. I collaborate with R&D teams to resolve critical issues and have developed a deep understanding of blockchain 
technology. My experience includes working with Kubernetes for log analysis and developing SQL-based automation solutions that have reduced 
issue resolution time by 20%.</p>
